PUSH_SWAP
Small peek in the world of algorithms. 

This project goal is to learn more about sorting algorithm, wich one to chose and when. If you're currently doing the project and want to know where to start, I highly suggest you take some time to learn about sorting algorithm first. 
Should it be a radix, implementation sort, bubble, turkish, quick sort or maybe a mix of your own ? These are very interesting topics if you like logics problem and the competition for the best result possible. 

WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO ?

Write a program called push_swap that receive a bunch of unique random integer, store it in in a tab or a linked list (up to you) and sort the list with a pre-set of operation between the 2 tab/stacks. The program must not return the sorted list, but
should instead print every operation.
